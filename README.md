## About The Project

The TSS Widgets project, derived from the [SemLookP](https://semanticlookup.zbmed.de/) project and now hosted on
GitHub under the [TS4NFDI](https://github.com/ts4nfdi) repository, is a collection of interactive widgets designed to
ease the integration of terminology service functions into third-party applications.

In [this Storybook](https://ts4nfdi.github.io/terminology-service-suite/comp/latest/), you will find an interactive documentation of the
widget component library.

The widgets are built using React and TypeScript and can be used in both React and plain HTML applications. The
functionality and arguments are the same for the React and plain HTML versions. Only the code snippet you get when you
click "Show code" in the Storybook is different.
