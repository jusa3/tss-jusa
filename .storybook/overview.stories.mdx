<p style={{fontSize:20}}>In this Storybook, you will find an interactive documentation of the widget component library derived from the semantic lookup service SemLookP.</p>

<p style={{fontSize:20}}>The widgets are built with React and TypeScript and can be used in both React (see REACT section) and plain HTML (see HTML section) applications. The functionality and arguments for the React and plain HTML versions are the same. Only the code snippet received by clicking "Show code" differs.</p>
